## 🏄 What's the game about?
**BOUNCE** is a fast-paced, movement-driven arcade shooter where bullets ricochet endlessly and style is survival. Slide, boost, and trick your way through floating monoliths while unleashing bouncing projectiles in a chaotic bullet-hell playground. Originally built for **Bullet Hell Jam 6**, now fully expanded for release.
